It looks like you're using the `react-fast-marquee` library to create a scrolling effect on your `ContactPage`. However, if the `Marquee` component with the `direction="down"` is causing issues where the element is randomly being removed or not displaying correctly, you might need to look into alternative ways to achieve the desired effect or troubleshoot the `react-fast-marquee` implementation.

### Troubleshooting `react-fast-marquee`

1. **Library Version**: Make sure you are using the latest version of `react-fast-marquee`. Sometimes, bugs are fixed in newer releases.

2. **CSS Conflicts**: Check if there are any CSS rules that might be affecting the behavior of the `Marquee` component. Ensure there are no conflicting styles that might be causing the element to disappear.

3. **Component Structure**: Verify that your component structure and imports are correct. Sometimes issues arise from incorrect imports or component structure.

### Alternative Solution Using CSS Animations

If `react-fast-marquee` continues to cause problems, you can achieve a similar scrolling effect using CSS animations. Below is a modified version of your `ContactPage` component using CSS animations:

#### CSS

Add the following CSS to your `ContactPageStyle.css`:



```css
#contact-box {
  position: relative;
  height: 300px; /* Adjust height as needed */
  overflow: hidden;
}

#cb-mid-bar {
  position: absolute;
  animation: scrollDown 10s linear infinite;
  width: 100%; /* Adjust width as needed */
  text-align: center;
}

@keyframes scrollDown {
  0% {
    transform: translateY(-100%);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateY(100%);
  }
}

#journal-box-head {
  /* Your existing styles */
}

#journal-box-title {
  /* Your existing styles */
}

#journal-box-sub {
  /* Your existing styles */
}

#journal-box-sub-img {
  /* Your existing styles */
}
```

#### React Component

Update your `ContactPage` component:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import FlowBar from "../assets/flow-bar-full.png";
import "../css/ContactPageStyle.css";
import subBarimg from "../assets/subBarCon.png";

function ContactPage() {
  return (
    <div id="contact-box">
      <div id="journal-box-head">
        <div id="journal-box-title">Nexus</div>
        <div id="journal-box-sub">
          <img id="journal-box-sub-img" src={subBarimg} alt="" />
          <div id="journal-box-sub-head">
            Please no gang signs. No, throw it up. I'm kidding.
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="cb-mid-bar">
        <img src={FlowBar} alt="" />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ContactPage;
```

### Explanation

- **CSS Animation**: The `@keyframes scrollDown` animation moves the `#cb-mid-bar` element from top to bottom continuously. You can adjust the `10s` duration to make the animation slower or faster.
- **Positioning**: The `#contact-box` has `overflow: hidden` to ensure that only the part of the `#cb-mid-bar` within its boundaries is visible, creating a scrolling effect.

This approach avoids potential issues with third-party libraries and gives you more control over the scrolling effect.
